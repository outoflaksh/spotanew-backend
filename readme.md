# Spotanew Backend API

I made an app to help discover new songs called [Spotanew](https://spotanew.vercel.app). This is the source code for the backend for that application. It's an entirely rewritten backend code, where I shifted the framework from Flask to FastAPI, added a cache layer with Redis, Dockerized the server, and actively working on adding more features to make the backend truly reliable, secure, available, and robust.
